# ðŸŽ§ A Spotify Clone Data Analysis Project

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective:**
Create a data-driven analysis of a music streaming platform, "Spotify Clone." This project aims to simulate the process of analyzing user behavior, music preferences, and trends, just like data analysts at Spotify would. The goal is to derive insights that can help improve user experience, recommend songs, and drive business growth.

## **Project Breakdown**

### **1. Data Collection**
- **Key Datasets to Create**:
  - **Users**: User demographics, registration date, location.
  - **Songs**: Song ID, artist, genre, release date, song length.
  - **Listening History**: User ID, Song ID, Timestamp, Listening Duration.
  - **User Preferences**: Usersâ€™ liked songs, playlists, followed artists.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **User Behavior**:
  - Analyze which times of day users are most active.
  - Identify top genres and artists.
  - Determine the average listening duration per session.
- **Song Popularity**:
  - Identify the most popular songs and genres over time.
  - Analyze the impact of song release dates on popularity.
- **User Segmentation**:
  - Group users by listening habits (e.g., genre preference, active hours).
  - Analyze how different user segments interact with the platform.

### **3. Data Visualization**
- **Tools**: Use tools like `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, or `Power BI`.
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - Heatmaps of user activity throughout the day/week.
  - Bar charts showing the top genres/artists.
  - Line graphs tracking song popularity over time.
  - Pie charts for user segmentation.

### **4. Predictive Analysis**
- **Recommendations**:
  - Build a basic recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
  - Predict which songs a user might like based on their history and similar users.
- **Churn Analysis**:
  - Predict which users are at risk of leaving the platform based on their activity patterns.

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python**: For data manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`) and visualization (`Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`).
- **SQL**: For querying and managing your datasets.
- **Excel**: For basic data analysis and visualization.
- **Tableau/Power BI**: For advanced data visualization.
